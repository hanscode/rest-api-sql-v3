### Project 9: REST API using Express
Author - Hans Steffens

## Project Overview
This project is about a REST API using Express. This API provides a way to administer a school database containing information about users and courses. Users can interact with the database to create new courses, retrieve information on existing courses, and update or delete existing courses. To make changes to the database, users are required to log in so the API also allows users to create a new account or retrieve information on an existing account.

## Technologies used in this project
To complete this project, I've used my knowledge of Node.js, Express, REST APIS, and Sequelize. Also I've worked with Postman for testing the application. 

## ðŸ›  Installation & Set Up

1. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Create database and seed it with initial data
   
    ```sh
   npm run seed
   ```

3. Start the development server

   ```sh
   npm start

## âœ… Testing via Postman

This project includes a Postman Collection that can be used to test the REST-API application. Open Postman and import the `RESTAPI.postman_collection.json` file.
